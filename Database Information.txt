DATA SET 1
--------------
BUAA-visnir face database
description : The dataset BUAA used in this paper contains 1350
instances of 150 categories. Each instance has visible images (VIS) and near infrared images (NIR),
which naturally form a two-view dataset

Sample -  1350
Feature - reduced 10x10 and convert to 1x100 vector
View - View 1 =  Visible images (VIS) , View 2 = Infrared Image (NIR),
category - 150

target - data =>data {1350x100}  , label= {1350x1} ,
